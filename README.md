# go

- Simpler objects, now this could be an advantage or disadvantage, but the idea is that Go is essentially object oriented although, some might disagree, but it has this concept of objects, and these objects are generally, the object orientation is a little simplified as compared to other languages. So, this is good, it makes it easier to code.

- Go is actually a simpler object-oriented implementation than you would see in other languages like C++.

- Okay, now, this translation step, it can go on in one of roughly two ways. It can be compiled, it can be a compilation or interpretation, okay?

- Now, a compiled language is a language where the translation from high-level language to machine code happens one time before you execute the code, before you deploy the code, happens one time, okay? So, like in C, C++, Go, Java partially, there's a compiler, and you compile the code.

- So, the idea behind a compiled languages, the key thing we want to bring out anyway is the fact that this translation occurs once, it doesn't occur while you're running the code, right?
